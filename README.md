# Elo_N_Tasks 

The community system for NAQD methods assessment and benchmarking

## The Structure

--> **Sandbox**

 This folder contains the initiation of this project, with the key scripts and
 proof-of-the-principle examples which are used in the Perspective paper I'm 
 currently preparing. Hopefully, one day, we can expand this repository along the
 ways discussed in the perspective to conduct automatic benchmarking and ranking of
 NAQD methods.
